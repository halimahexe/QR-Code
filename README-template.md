### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is a really useful reference to the things you can do with Flexbox.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - Although I used the free version of Frontend Mentor, so didn't have access to their Figma files, I used Figma to figure out approximate sizes of elements to get it as close as possible to the target.
